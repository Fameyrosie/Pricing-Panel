### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
1. Using CSS Tools: Reset CSS to create a clean slate for your project.
2. Settingg box-sizing: border-size to make the spacing easier because it takes into account the border (this is set in html element along with font for this project)
3. I learned the using margin: 0 auto centers the container
